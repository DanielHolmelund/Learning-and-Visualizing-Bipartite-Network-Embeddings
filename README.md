#  Project for learning and visualizing bipartite network embeddings.

This project is the result of the course "Fagprojekt 02466". In this project the relevans of a latent space model in the context of single-cell transcripttomics was investigated. The report is available in this repository.

In acording to a non disclose agreement with the Novo Nordisk Foundation for Basic Metabolic Research, we are not allowed to share the data which lays the foundation for this project. 

The main scripts of interest are the "Embeddings_single_cell.py", "Binary_link_pred_single_cell.py" and "Poisson_link_pred_single_cell.py.
